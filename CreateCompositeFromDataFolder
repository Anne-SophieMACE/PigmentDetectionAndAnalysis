The 5 colors 47 slices stack needs to be re-created from the images in Data (saved as "Image Sequence"):
First, import the Data as Image Sequence in Fiji:
File > Import > Image Sequence
This will open a 235 slices stack.
Then convert in 5-colors 47 slices by:
Image > HyperStack > Stack to HyperStack
Choose the order as : xyczt; 5 colors and 47 slices
Save this as TIFF, and choose this file at the beginning of the macro
