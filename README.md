# PigmentDetectionAndAnalysis
This repository contains the codes used for the publication "Keratin 5 intermediate filaments mechanically control the position of melanin pigments for genome photoprotection" by S. Benito-Martinez et al.

The macros are compatible with Fiji version 1.52p (available here in Fiji archives: https://downloads.imagej.net/fiji/archive/20191216-2110/); in later versions, we saw some bugs with the slice association for ROIs. The code was not tested for earlier versions.
